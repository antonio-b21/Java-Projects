<h2>MazeRunner game</h2>

<p>Generate a <b>random</b> square maze having the dimension of your choice and after you have tried to find the solution you can <b>verify</b> it by displaying the correct one.</p>

<p>The generation of the maze uses <b>Kruskal's algorithm</b> to extract the minimum spanning tree of a set of nodes whose randomly weighted edges resemble a grid. The resulting tree represents the <b>inside</b> of the maze, to which are added walls and two exits. This guarantees <b>only one</b> solution.</p>
